 # Splunk4Champions 2.0 -> _Splunk SE Workshop for advanced users_

## This is a complete re-design from https://github.com/bautt/splunk4champions training 
## 
This repository houses a new version of the Splunk4Champions workshop. The content management has been redesigned to work with React.js, Splunk UI and MDX files.

Splunk4Champions is  a presales workshop for more experienced Splunk users (champions) who are still willing to learn some new tricks and get deeper understanding of how Splunk search works.
We want to share hints & tricks on how to use Splunk searches more efficiently and also provide some underlying theory for that. This is an interactive hands-on workshop which will require your participation and also provide your dozens of follow-up links to find more information. 

### Target audience: 
Advanced Splunk users 
Splunk admins

### Content:
- Options and GUI Settings
- Using Job Inspector
- How is data stored in Splunk
- Search performance: good and bad searches
- Converting log data to metrics
- Dashboard hints



### Benefit:
- Sustainable and energy saving usage of Splunk
- New insights and inspiration

### Design Goals: 
Zero-Powerpoint: all information needed is included in the app

## Download and installation:
For simple installaiton just download the release https://github.com/bautt/splunk4champions2/releases/ (look left) and install it as normal Splunk app. It should work on and 8+ versions and in Splunk Cloud. It should do no harm but is not meant to be installed on production systems - so no warranty.
