## Using Forwarders
Write metrics to a file and extract _time, metric_name(s) and dim(s) fields and send it to the metrics index through UF
___
## Using HEC 
Use a HEC to receive events send via HTTP(S). Send multivalue metric through curl to HEC example:

`curl -k https://SPLUNK_SERVER:8088/services/collector -H "Authorization: Splunk YOUR_HEC_ID" 
-d '{"time": 1486683865.000,"event":"metric","source":"disk","host":"host_1.splunk.com","fields"
:{"region":"us-west-1","datacenter":"dc1","rack":"63","os":"Ubuntu16.10","arch":"x64","team":"LON",
"service":"6","service_version":"0","service_environment":"test","path":"/dev/sda1","fstype":"ext3",
"metric_name:cpu.usr": 11.12,"metric_name:cpu.sys": 12.23, "metric_name:cpu.idle": 13.34}}'`

## Log2metrics conversion
### Log2metrics conversion at the ingest time
Use “Log to Metrics” category and create a new source type
json, csv, tsv, psv, w3c,field_extraction
### Log2metrics conversion after ingest
Use mcollect / meventcollect commands. New data will be written to metrics index after each search performed.
mcollect converts events in to metric data points and inserts it into a metric index
meventcollect takes streaming output and inserts events in to a metric index on indexers.
