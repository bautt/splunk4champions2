## Create Indexes  (Splunk Cloud AND Splunk Enterprise)
Before we continue with example data we need to create indexes for it. Go to Settings -> Data -> Indexes and create 3 indexes: 
Index size 3GB, for cloud: retention at least 1y. 
1. s4c_stocks (default)
2. s4c_weather (default)
3. s4c_metrics (metric index)

##  (Splunk Enterprise only)

## Enable Data Sources
Go to the [Link to pre-configured data sources](../../manager/splunk4champions2/data/inputs/monitor?search=s4c&count=25) and click on "Enable"
-> If you have no internet connection, you are done now. The data will be at least several weeks old.

## Add data using custom search command:  (Splunk Cloud AND Splunk Enterprise)

Please only run once! 

<SplunkSearch earliest="-2y" latest="now" spl={`| getweather
| spath output=_time path=dt 
| eval sourcetype="s4c:weather", source="s4c_data" 
\`\`\`| collect index=s4c_weather  output_format=hec\`\`\`
`}></SplunkSearch>

If your server has an internet connection and custom command works you are finished.

## Update example data  (optional)

If you would like to get most recent example  data from the apps github-repository enable *download_data.py* scripted input. 
 [Link to scripted input](../../manager/search/data/inputs/script?search=s4c) 
 
 * To control success you can search for the script output in the _internal index: 
 `index=_internal source=s4c*`
 * The message should look like: 
 `2022-11-07 13:08:08 /opt/splunk/etc/apps/splunk4champions2/static/current.log.gz Splunk4Champions2 download script for weather data was finished in 6.2 seconds.
