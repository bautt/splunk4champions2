## What is in a Bucket?

<img width="50%" src="/static/app/splunk4champions2/images/inabucket.png"/>
A bucket is a file system directory containing a portion of a Splunk Enterprise index. A Splunk Enterprise index typically consists of many buckets, organized by age.
Real directory with weather data index:

Size of the files depends on data. In this case the tsidx files are 225MB for 78MB of compressed data. 
I used zstd and uncompressed journal.zst and the uncompressed data was 1,4GB in size. 
Merged lexicon file in the directory is a part of search index too, it is used to support typeahead. It is also required by walklex command. 



Note: The bucket search command is not related to the index buckets described here. Its purpose is to put continuous numerical values into discrete sets or bins. The bucket command is actually an alias for the bin command. See the bin command in the Search Reference.

## Bloomfilter
A data structure that you use to test whether an element is a member of a set. 
Splunk Enterprise uses bloom filters to decrease the time it requires to retrieve events from the index. This strategy is effective when you search for rare terms.

Best way to understand the bloomfilter is to explore it in the interactive demo:

## TSIDX file
A time-series index file, also called an index file. A tsidx file associates each unique keyword in your data with location references to events, 
which are stored in a companion rawdata file. Together, the rawdata file and its related tsidx files make up the contents of an index bucket.

## journal.gz

A compressed file in an index bucket that contains event data, as well as journal information that the indexer can use to reconstitute the indexâ€™s index files.
The rawdata file and the index files together constitute the files in a bucket.
