### Best search is an avoided search :)


The "base search" in Splunk refers to the initial search query that retrieves the raw data from indexed sources. 
It forms the foundation for a  subsequent post-processing searches, which are additional queries applied to the retrieved data for filtering, 
transforming, and aggregating the results to extract meaningful insights in different panels. 

A base search should be a transforming search which is used to produce a formatted statistics table. 
Post-process searches are used to process / filter the table and present the results in different panels.
Post-process searches can only reference fields present in the base search results.

Multiple base searches can be used in one dashboard and referenced by name.

See a base search example - open the  <Link to="basesearch" openInNewContext>Basesearch dashboard example</Link>.

Base search is defined at the beginning of the dashboard:

and referenced in different panels with some post-process search: 

<img src="/static/app/splunk4champions2/images/base2.png" width="50%" />

The resulting dashboard has 8 different panels, but all are based on the same base search with some post-processing.
