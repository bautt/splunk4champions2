## Visual Editor
Base search handling is improved in Dashboard Studio. You do not need to edit the source, base and chain searches can be created and assigned in
 the UI making it much easier to create and understand. 

## Multiple searches
 Dashboard Studio allows multiple chain searches in a chain. 

## Use a transforming base search or fields
The base search itself has to be transforming (using stats, chart, timechart). If the base search is a non-transforming search, 
you must explicitly state in the base search what fields will be used in the chain search using the | fields command. 




Here is an example dashboard for base and chain searches  in DS: <Link to="ds_base_search" openInNewContext>Base search (Dashboard Studio)</Link>
