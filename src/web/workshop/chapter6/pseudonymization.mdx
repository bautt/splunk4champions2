## Hiding Usernames and Other PID Data

* Anonymization: Irreversibly replace data
* Pseudonymization: Reversibly replace data

### How to hide or reveal PID data depending on the Role:

Consider the following scenario: 
A Level 1 analyst group should be able to view dashboards without seeing clear names. 
Level 2 analysts, who have a different Splunk user role, should also not see clear names by default, 
but they should have the ability to reveal the names with a click (this action is audited and documented).

This approach only hides data at the presentation layer. 
Additional measures are required to prevent unauthorized searches. 
For enhanced security, you may choose to pseudonymize data at index time and optionally store it in two separate indexes.

If you need to  hide data at presentation layer: 
* "your_search" | eval user=sha256(user)
 
 In addition to hiding the data in the dashboard, you will also need to apply user lockdown: no search app, no raw events.

In our example we create a dashboard which hides user names by default and only members of the admin group can use a switch to display clear names.
