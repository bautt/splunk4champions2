## Tokens from inputs
Tokens from inputs work the same way like in xml dashboards. Inputs can be used above and inside canvas. Inputs with no data available can be hidden.

## Tokens from search
Dashboard Studio has the ability to reference any search results directly as a token. The syntax used is "$data source name:result.field$"

## Drilldown tokens and conditional hiding
Since version 9.1 (Cloud 9.0.2303) you can hide panels in the dashboard if the search has no results. This feature is called conditionally visible panels. 
The logic behind it can also be used to make panels dependent on a particular token. If the token is not set to a defined value the search would return no results and the panel will be hidden.
