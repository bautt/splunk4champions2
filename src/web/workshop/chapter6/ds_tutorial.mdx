import SplunkSearch from '../../components/SplunkSearch.js'
import Link from '@splunk/react-ui/Link'

You may complete the * <Link to="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/DashStudio/uploadData" openInNewContext>"Dashboard Studio Tutorial"</Link> 
in this App. The tutorial data is already uploaded to  `s4c_tutorial ` index and the lookup  `prices.csv ` is already configured. 

1) Check the data (if you do not see any, try increasing the time range)
<SplunkSearch earliest="-30d" latest="now" spl={`index=s4c_tutorial`}></SplunkSearch>
2) Check if automatic lookup is working: look for the fields like  `price` and  `product_name` 

3) <Link to="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.3/DashStudio/dashCanvas" openInNewContext>"Create a new dashboard"</Link>

4) Follow steps 4-10 <Link to="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.3/DashStudio/addTable" openInNewContext>"Tutorial Steps 4-10"</Link>

5) At step 11: instead of simply uploading the images use relative links. The images are already uploaded to the ../splunk4champions2/appserver/static/images directory 
and can be referenced by a relative link: '/en-US/static/app/splunk4champions2/images/ButtercupMascotDashStudio.png' and `/en-US/static/app/splunk4champions2/images/ButtercupGames_RectanglesBG2png.png``

6) The result should look like this: 

<img width="80%" src="/static/app/splunk4champions2/images/ds_studio_tutorial.png"/>
