## Token switches

Splunk XML-Dashboards allow you to set and unset tokens and pass the values to other panels. Some tokens are set by actions 
(for example mouse click event). In the example below we use a click action to determine which visualization should be shown. 

<img src="/static/app/splunk4champions2/images/selectviz2.gif" width="80%"/>

Go to <Link to="switches" openInNewContext>Token switches</Link>

First we are setting tokens by clicking on the table: 
<img src="/static/app/splunk4champions2/images/tokenviz1.png" width="80%" />

Then we define two panels each depending on different token: 
<img src="/static/app/splunk4champions2/images/tokenviz1.png" width="80%" />
