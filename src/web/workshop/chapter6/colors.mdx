## Splunk default vs assigned colors

Splunk default colors changed in version 9.x. If you prefer to assign your own, possibly a more decent color scheme, you can assign colors in dashboards. 

<img src="/static/app/splunk4champions2/images/piechartcolors.png" width="80%" /> \

 <Link to="tstats-trelis" openInNewContext>Dashboard with a Pie</Link>

and look for this line:

`<option name="charting.fieldColors">{"Clouds": 0xc5dddd, "Clear": 0x6495ED, "Rain":0x2F4F4F, "Snow":0xa6eded}</option>` \
You can explore `seriesColors` as alternative to `fieldColors` if you do not want to use the names of the fields. in this case you just asign a list of colors to the series, not to a known field.
 
Here is an example for Charts:
