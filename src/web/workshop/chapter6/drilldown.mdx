## Drilldown Examples

Set a token while zooming on a chart to zoom on other charts. Add this feature to your dashboard to make it more appealing :)
See a base search example <Link to="drilldown" openInNewContext>Drilldown dashboard</Link>  look at the source code and explain it. 

First we use a chart where a selection will set two tokens: selection_earliest and selection_latest: 

<img src="/static/app/splunk4champions2/images/drilldown1.png" width="60%" /> 

We use those tokens for the time range definition in the second panel: 

<img src="/static/app/splunk4champions2/images/drilldown2.png" width="80%" /> 

The result is a dynamic <Link to="drilldown" openInNewContext>Drilldown dashboard</Link> 

<img src="/static/app/splunk4champions2/images/drilldown.png" width="80%" /> \
