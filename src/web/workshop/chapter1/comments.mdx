## Inline Comments
You can add inline comments to the search string of a saved 
search by enclosing the comments in backtick characters (\`\`\`)

## Use inline comments to:

* Explain each "step" of a complicated search that is shared with other users.
* Discuss ways of improving a search with other users.
* Leave notes for yourself in unshared searches that are works in progress.
* Troubleshoot searches by running them with chunks of SPL "commented out".
