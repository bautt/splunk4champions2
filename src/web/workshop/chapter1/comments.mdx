## Inline Comments
You can add inline comments to the search string of a saved 
search by enclosing the comments in backtick characters (\`\`\`)

<div style={{padding: '1rem', backgroundColor: '#DAD7CD', 'font-family': 'Courier', 'font-color': '#FFFFFF', 'color': '#FFFFFF', 'font-size': '2rem'}}>
\`\`\` the code is documentation enough  \`\`\`
</div>

is not true for Splunk searches anymore.

## Use inline comments to:

* Explain each "step" of a complicated search that is shared with other users.
* Discuss ways of improving a search with other users.
* Leave notes for yourself in unshared searches that are works in progress.
* Troubleshoot searches by running them with chunks of SPL "commented out".
