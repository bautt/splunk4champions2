When a user logs in, Splunk automatically uses the language that the user's browser is set to. To switch languages, change the browser's locale setting. Locale configurations are browser-specific.

Splunk detects locale strings. A locale string contains two components: a language specifier and a localization specifier. This is usually presented as two lowercase letters and two uppercase letters linked by an underscore. For example, "en_US" means US English and "en_GB" means British English and "de_DE" means German.
