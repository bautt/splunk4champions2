**Fast mode** uses the least amount of system resources. It is great to use Fast Mode when merely checking if data is present or not or after a search is already built.

Try this simple search out in different modes: 

<SplunkSearch earliest="-30d" latest="now" mode="fast" spl={`&#x60;s4c_index_weather&#x60;`}>
</SplunkSearch>

* If you see no data in the s4c_data and s4c_stocks index, please go to section 0-Setup and follow the instructions (create indexes and add exanple data)
