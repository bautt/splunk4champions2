**Fast mode** uses the least amount of system resources. It is great to use Fast Mode when merely checking if data is present or not or after a search is already built.

Try this simple search out in different modes: 

<SplunkSearch earliest="-30d" latest="now" spl={`index=_internal`}>
</SplunkSearch>
