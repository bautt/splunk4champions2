## Splunk default vs assigned colors

Splunk default colors changed in version 9.x. If you prefer to assign your own, possibly a more decent color scheme, you can assign colors in dashboards.

 <Link to="tstats-trelis" openInNewContext>Dashboard with a Pie</Link>

and look for this line:

`<option name="charting.fieldColors">{"Clouds": 0xc5dddd, "Clear": 0x6495ED, "Rain":0x2F4F4F, "Snow":0xa6eded}</option>` \
You can explore `seriesColors` as alternative to `fieldColors` if you do not want to use the names of the fields. in this case you just asign a list of colors to the series, not to a known field.
 
Here is an example for Charts:

Another example on how to use assigned colors to create meaningful pie charts is here: 
 <Link to="meaningful_pie_charts" openInNewContext>Meaningful pie charts in XML</Link>
 and the same dashboard in Dashboard Studio: 
 <Link to="meaningful_pie_charts_ds" openInNewContext>Meaningful pie charts in DS</Link>
