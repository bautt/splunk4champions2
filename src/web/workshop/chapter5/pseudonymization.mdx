## User names and other PID data

* Anonymization: Irreversibly replace data
* Pseudonymization: Reversibly replace data

If you need to  hide data at presentation layer: 
* "your_search" | eval user=sha256(user)
* Can use your own custom search command
 
 in addition to hiding the data in the dashboard, you will also need to apply user lockdown: no search app, no raw events.

In our example we create a dashboard which hides user names by default and only members of the admin group can use a switch to display clear names.
