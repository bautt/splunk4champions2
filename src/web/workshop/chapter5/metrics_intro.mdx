## Metrics
Since Splunk version 7 you can store metric data not only as plain text in the event index but also or alternatively in metrix index.
A metric is a mesurement at a specific point in time which can be enriched by dimensions. A single metric data point can contain one timestamp but multiple measurements and multiple dimensions.

### Time 
By default Splunk  metrics are searchable by second, but you can configure metric indexes with millisecond timestamps if needed. 

### Metric Name 
Metric names use dots to separate their namespaces into segments.

### Numeric values
A number (integer or double float) representing the value of a metric at a given point of time, such as a count.

### Measurement
Combinations of metric names and numeric values 

### Dimensions
Metadata fields that provide additional information about the measurements.
