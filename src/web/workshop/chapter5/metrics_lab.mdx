import SplunkSearch from '../../components/SplunkSearch.js'


###  If you are not on Splunk Show: Create metrics index named “s4c_metrics”

## CONVERT WEATHER DATA TO METRICS

<SplunkSearch earliest="-2y" latest="now" spl={`index=s4c_weather earliest="-2y" latest=now() Orlando OR Vilnius OR Frankfurt OR Brussels OR Austin OR Warsaw OR Prague OR Sydney OR Stockholm OR London OR Bonn OR Copenhagen OR Zurich
| rename clouds.all AS weather.Clouds main.temp AS weather.Temperature main.temp_max AS weather.MaxTemp main.temp_min AS weather.MinTemp main.humidity AS weather.Humidity main.pressure AS weather.Pressure wind.speed AS weather.Windspeed visibility AS weather.Visibility wind.deg AS weather.WindDirection coord.lat AS weather.Lat coord.lon AS weather.Lon weather{}.id AS weather.Id
| stats first(weather.*) by _time name
| rename first(*) AS *
| filldown
\`\`\`| mcollect index=s4c_metrics split=true name\`\`\`
`}></SplunkSearch>

Remove the comments from: 
`| mcollect index=s4c_metrics split=true name` 
once the index is ready and you want the data to be saved in the metrics index. 

## Quiz

Here is an example: which search is better suitable to be used as a base search in a weather dashboard? 
<SplunkSearch earliest="-2y" latest="now" spl={`
index=s4c_weather 
|bin _time span=4h
| stats avg(main*) BY name _time
`}></SplunkSearch>

OR 

<SplunkSearch earliest="-2y" latest="now" spl={`
| mstats avg(weather.*)  prestats=true WHERE "index"="s4c_metrics" span=4h BY name
| stats avg(weather.*) BY name _time
| fields - _span*
`}></SplunkSearch>
