## Annotation Search

Annotations allow you to add context information to
the time series data. For example, if you have a chart 
that shows some app behaviour over the last week, you can add an event annotation that flags 
the changes or restarts. It is basically an additional search running in parallel and looking for related events.
Annotations are supported for charts, column charts, and area charts. In order to create an event annotation you have to edit xml.

Annotation search is defined immediateley after the "main" search in the same chart and panel:

You can also use annotations in Dashbaord Studio. The syntax is a bit different: you will need a search which produces a table with 
following columns: annotationX e.g. time, annotationLabel - message or label and annotationColor.  See following example for the DS dashbaord:
