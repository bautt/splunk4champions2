### Splunk Secure Gateway  
The Splunk Secure Gateway is the centralized admin service that powers Splunk Mobile connectivity. It uses the **Spacebridge** cloud service to establish an end-to-end encrypted WebSocket tunnel between mobile apps and your Splunk Enterprise or Cloud instance—without opening any inbound firewall ports.

- **Encryption & Compliance**  
  - SOC 2 Type 2 and ISO 27001 certified  
  - HIPAA and PCI-DSS compliant  

- **SSO Integration**  
  - Configure SAML on the Secure Gateway for seamless single sign-on  

- **Network Requirements**  
  - Outbound TCP/443 to `prod.spacebridge.spl.mobi`  
  - No inbound ports required
