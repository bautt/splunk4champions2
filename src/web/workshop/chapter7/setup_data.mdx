## Create Indexes 
Before we continue with example data we need to create indexes for it. Go to Settings -> Data -> Indexes and create 3 indexes: 

1. s4cstocks (default)
2. s4cweather (default)
3. s4cmetrics (metric index)

## Enable Data Sources

Go to the [Link to pre-configured data sources](../../manager/splunk4champions2/data/inputs/monitor?search=s4c&count=25) and click on "Enable"

## Update example data  (optional)

If you would like to get most recent example  data from the apps github-repository enable *download_data.py* scripted input. 
 [Link to scripted input](../../manager/search/data/inputs/script?search=s4c) 
 To control success you can search for the script output in the _internal index: 
 `index=_internal source=s4c*`

 The message should look like:
