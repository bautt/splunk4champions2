If you want to see what fields are actually indexed fields and what terms are in your tsidx you can use * <Link to="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/SearchReference/Walklex" openInNewContext>walklex</Link>
command.

<table width="100%">
        <tr width="60%">
           <td width="40%"><img src="/static/app/splunk4champions2/images/walklex_man1.png" width="80%"/></td>
           <td>
           <li>Walklex command  only works on warm and cold buckets, recently indexed data in hot buckets will not be considered. </li>
           <li>Users can only run walklex command if their role has following capabilities: "run_walklex" OR "admin_all_objects". </li>
           <li> Walklex command does not work if your role has search filters added.</li>
           </td>
        </tr>
      </table>


### Display indexed fields and the count (type=fieldvalue)
<SplunkSearch earliest="-30d" latest="now" spl={`|walklex \`s4c_index_tutorial\` type=fieldvalue|stats sum(count) by term`}>
</SplunkSearch>

### Display TERMS and the count (type=term)
<SplunkSearch earliest="-30d" latest="now" spl={`|walklex \`s4c_index_tutorial\` type=term|stats sum(count) by term`}>
</SplunkSearch>

### Add prefix to filter results
<SplunkSearch earliest="-30d" latest="now" spl={`|walklex \`s4c_index_tutorial\` type=term prefix=http`}>
</SplunkSearch>

 You may also notice the source field of the walklex output contains something like: **s4c_tutorial~0~E7F9BD44-1185-4AD9-85D0-F6DEAD372EC1**
 it is composed from index name, bucket id and indexer guid: **index-id-guId**
