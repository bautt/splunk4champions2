## TERM directive avoids splitting in (minor) TERMs 

### Using term in a search
Compare: 
<SplunkSearch earliest="-30d" latest="now" spl={`index=_internal 127.0.0.1`}>
</SplunkSearch>

To: 

<SplunkSearch earliest="-30d" latest="now" spl={`index=_internal TERM(127.0.0.1)`}>
</SplunkSearch>

The example search can be dangerous in some cases: if you have an event like this: 
> ` 2023-03-27 09:12:23.456 ip=1.2.3.4 source: 9.8.7.6 ` 

the search for ` TERM(1.2.3.4)`  will not find this event! 
You should use  ` TERM(ip=1.2.3.4)` instead!

### TERM can only be used with minor breakers, not with major breakers
