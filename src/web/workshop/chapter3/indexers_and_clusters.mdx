## Distributed Architecture example 
Note: Indexer clusters are groups of Splunk Enterprise indexers configured to replicate each others' data, so that the system keeps multiple copies of all data.
 This process is known as index replication. Indexers also participate in the search process and help to scale searches.
  By maintaining multiple, identical copies of Splunk Enterprise data, clusters prevent data loss while promoting data availability for searching.

Commands where the search order does not matter are called distributable streaming commands. Distributable streaming commands run on Indexers.

This is just one example of possible architecture, see [Splunk Validated Architectures](https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/technical-briefs/splunk-validated-architectures.pdf) for more.
