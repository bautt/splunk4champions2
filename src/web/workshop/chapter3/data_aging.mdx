## Data life cycle 

<img src="/static/app/splunk4champions2/images/hot_warm1.png" width="700" />

## Hot/Warm Storage
New data lives here
At least 1 hot bucket per index, per indexer
800+ IOPS (!)

## Buckets roll from Hot to Warm when....
* We get too many hot buckets [maxHotBuckets]
* The timespan of a bucket gets too large
* A hot bucket hasn’t received data in a while
* Bucket metadata files have grown too large
* There is an index clustering replication error

### Cold Storage
* Historical data goes here
* Allows older data to be kept on slower (cheaper) storage
* Don’t go below 350 IOPS

## Buckets roll from Warm to Cold when...

We get too many Warm buckets [maxWarmDBCount]
Frozen Storage
No longer searchable
Data rolls from Cold to Frozen when...

The total size of the index (Hot+Warm+Cold) grows too large
The oldest event in a bucket exceeds a specific age

## When do we roll data?

Control retention for all indexes that reference the volume. Oldest bucket in the volume is deleted/frozen when defined size is exceeded.

## SmartStore

A SmartStore-enabled index minimizes its use of local storage, with the bulk of its data residing on remote object stores such as S3 or GCS.

Indexing and searching of data occurs on the indexer, just as in a traditional deployment that stores all data locally.

The key difference with SmartStore is that the remote object store becomes the location for master copies of warm buckets, while the indexer's local storage is used to cache copies of warm buckets currently participating in a search or that have a high likelihood of participating in a future search.

A cache manager on the indexer fetches copies of warm buckets from the remote store and places them in the indexer's local cache when the buckets are needed for a search. The cache manager also evicts warm bucket copies from the cache once their likelihood of being searched again diminishes.

## tsidx reduction
https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.1/Indexer/Reducetsidxdiskusage
The tsidx reduction process eliminates the full-size tsidx files and replaces them with mini versions of those files that contain essential metadata. 
The rawdata files and some other metadata files remain untouched. You can continue to search across the aged data, if necessary, but such searches will exhibit significantly worse performance. Rare term searches, in particular, will run slowly.
