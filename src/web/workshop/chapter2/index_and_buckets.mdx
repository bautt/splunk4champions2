## How is data stored? 
### Data Flow and Indexing
* HEC or forwarders send data to indexers in the cluster, where the data is immediately parsed and indexed.
* The indexed data is saved inside buckets, which are subdirectories under the folder for each Splunk index name.
### Replication Process
* The cluster's replication factor determines how many identical copies of each bucket are stored on separate indexers.
* Copies of buckets are distributed such that no indexer stores more than one copy of the same bucket.
### Folder structure
* Each index has its own folder (e.g., /opt/splunk/var/lib/splunk/\<indexname\>/).
* Each bucket folder name encodes its data time range and creation ID
* Replicated buckets (e.g., hot_v2, hot_v3) exist on different peer indexers to satisfy the clusters replication factor.
* Searchable copies contain both rawdata and index files, while non-searchable copies store only rawdata

## What is an Index? 
### A Splunk index folder is a dedicated on-disk repository where Splunk Enterprise stores and organizes indexed data.
The index folder contains:
* Compressed raw data files representing the original events.
* Index files (e.g., .tsidx files) that map keywords to event locations for rapid searching.
* Metadata supporting efficient data management and retrieval.

## What is a Bucket?
A bucket in Splunk is a directory within an index folder that stores both the raw event data and the associated index files needed for searching. Buckets organize data based on its age and lifecycle stage
