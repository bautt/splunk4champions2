SmartStore Architecture

SmartStore decouples compute from storage by maintaining most indexed data on remote object stores (AWS S3, Google GCS, Azure Blob Storage) while keeping a local cache on indexers for active searching.

## How It Works
* Hot Buckets: Newly indexed data resides locally and is replicated across indexers to meet the replication factor, exactly like traditional architecture.
* Warm Buckets: When a hot bucket rolls to warm, the indexer uploads a copy to remote storage. Once confirmed uploaded, the remote copy becomes the master copy. The local copy remains cached on the indexer but becomes eligible for eviction.
* Cache Manager: Manages local cache by fetching warm buckets from remote storage when needed for searches and evicting buckets based on recency, search frequency, and available space.
* Search Process: Splunk can only search locally cached data. If a search requires buckets not in cache, the cache manager downloads them from remote storage first.
* Indexer Clusters: Only hot buckets are replicated across peers. Warm buckets exist as a single copy on remote storage, with peers maintaining only metadata. This eliminates the need for multiple local copies and the cold bucket tier entirely.

Result: Dramatically reduces local storage requirements, eliminates frozen storage tiers, enables independent scaling of compute and storage, and trades some search performance for significant cost efficiency.

   Imagine a library where you have a reading desk and all other books are stored on shelves. Splunk SmartStore works similarly:

* Reading Table (Local Storage): Think of your reading desk as the local storage on your computer or server. It's where the books (data) you are currently using or need quick access to are kept.
* Bookshelves (Remote Storage): The bookshelves represent a larger, remote storage space where most of the books (data) are stored. This could be cloud storage or another form of external storage.
* Librarian (SmartStore Technology): The librarian is like the SmartStore technology. When you need a book that isn't on your table, the librarian quickly fetches it from the shelves and brings it to you. Similarly, SmartStore retrieves the necessary data from remote storage to local storage when you need it.
* Returning Books: Once you're done with a book, the librarian puts it back on the shelves, freeing up space on your table. In the same way, SmartStore moves data back to remote storage when it's no longer actively needed, optimizing the use of local storage.
* Searchable Books (Searchable Data): Even though some books are on the shelves and not on your table, you can still search for them. It just takes a bit longer for the librarian to bring them to your table. Similarly, with SmartStore, all data remains searchable, but accessing data from the remote storage may take a bit longer compared to accessing it from local storage.

In essence, SmartStore efficiently manages data placement, ensuring that only the necessary data is kept readily accessible while the rest remains searchable in remote storage, just like the librarian manages the flow of books between your table and the library's shelve.
