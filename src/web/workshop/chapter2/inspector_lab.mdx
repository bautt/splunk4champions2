import SplunkSearch from '../../components/SplunkSearch.js'
import Link from '@splunk/react-ui/Link'

Run the search, wait for it to finish, and click on "Job -> Inspect Job" to oberserve the details: 

<SplunkSearch earliest="-1y" latest="now"  spl={`index="s4c_weather" 
|bucket span=4h _time
|stats avg(main.temp) AS temp by name _time
|where name=="Berlin" OR name=="London" OR name=="Paris"
|xyseries _time, name, temp`}>
</SplunkSearch>


1. In the first line we see the number of results, scanned events and time. 
You can calculate events scanned per second from that. 

In this example we see something like: 
"This search has completed and has returned 2,169 results by scanning 1,355,725 events in 6.535 seconds"



2. Execution costs: time to process each component, number of invocation, input and output count
    * "command.search.index" -> time to read the idx files 
    * "command.search.rawdata" -> time to read rawdata
    * "command.search.filter" -> time to filter non-matching events
    * "command.search.kv" -> field extractions (analog for lookups, tags)
    * "command.search.typer" -> processing event types


3. Properties:  Under lower section "Search job properties" 
    * look for the "optimizedSearch" - is it different?
    * diskUsage - how much space the search is using?

* Alternatively look search for "lispy" in the search log


Now compare the results with this search: 
<SplunkSearch earliest="-1y" latest="now"  spl={`index="s4c_weather" Berlin OR London OR Paris 
|timechart  span=4h  avg(main.temp) by name`}>
</SplunkSearch>

* Would it be better to add 
    |fields name main.temp _time
after the first pipe?
