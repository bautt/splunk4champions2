There are six broad categorizations for almost all of the search commands:

* distributable streaming
* centralized streaming
* transforming
* generating
* orchestrating
* dataset processing

A streaming command operates on each event as it is returned by a search. 
Essentially one event in and one (or no) event out.

Typical distributable streaming commands are: eval, fields, head, iplocation, replace... 

A non-streaming command requires the events from all of the indexers before the command can operate on the entire set of events. Many transforming commands are non-streaming commands. There are also several commands that are not transforming commands but are also non-streaming. These non-transforming, non-streaming commands are most often dataset processing commands.

Example for transforming commands: addtotals, chart, mvcombine, rare, stats, table, timechart, top...
