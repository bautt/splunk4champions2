## 1. Only search in the index you need:

___

## 2. Restrict time range

___

## 3. Always think about the number of buckets to open

___
## 4. Tell exactly what you want (before the first pipe)

* Specify and limit the index(es) & other meta-fields like host(s), source(s) & sourcetype(s)
* Limit the time range for searching 
* Fine-tune your searches to your unique events as much as possible
* Reduce the number of fields being passed SPL pipeline for processing (use fields command)
* Place streaming commands earlier in the pipeline
___

## 5. Try to reduce the scan count
 When the scan count is high and the event count is low we are filtering events during schema on
the fly.
This is the most expensive place to filter as we have downloaded
buckets, open the tsidx, extracted slices fully parsed events. 

## Lispy Efficiency
Lispy expressions are predicates Splunk® platform uses to locate events. Finding Lispy in the search log is good for debugging. All events matching the predicates are scanned 
(scanned includes includes these steps: Read journal slice off disk, uncompress, fields, eventtypes, tags, lookups, postfilter). If you manage to scan fewer events, your search will be faster. 
Lispy efficiency can be defined as `eventCount / scanCount`
