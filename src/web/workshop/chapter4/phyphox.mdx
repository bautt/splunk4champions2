## Phyphox app on your phone
This project leverages the RWTH Phyphox app to collect sensor data from mobile devices, enabling real-time analytics and insights. 
Phyphox, developed by RWTH Aachen University, is popular and trusted because it combines scientific rigor with accessibility and a focus on privacy. 

## Lab - Send Phyphox Data
This lab contains following steps: 

1) Install the app on your phone (iPhone or Android) 
<Link to="https://phyphox.org/download/" openInNewContext> Phyphox App Download Page</Link>

2) Enable HEC : /en-GB/manager/splunk4champions2/http-eventcollector -> Edit Global Settings -> Enable
(Settings -> Data Inputs -> HTTP Event Collector -> Global Settings -> All Tokens "Enabled" )
    Copy token value for metrics data
3) Go to 
<Link to="download_phyphox_experiments" openInNewContext>Phyphox configuration generator dashboard </Link> and configure your experiment. This config file will contain your splunk address and the hec token, so the app will be able to send json data directly to Splunk. 

4) Transfer the xml-configuration file to your phone: you can use the camera and scan the QR code, than open the link, download the file and open with the phyphox app. 

<table width="100%">
        <tr width="30%">
        <td>
        Use download and "open with" or "sent to" on your phone. If you are not able to select the "phyphox app" as a destination try using Chrome on iOS. 
       
        </td>
           <td width="70%"><img src="/static/app/splunk4champions2/images/phy_screen1-2.jpg" width="90%"/></td>
           
        </tr>
             <tr width="30%">
        <td>
    In the Phyphox app select Splunk experiments and start it. If no errors appear you have a good chance to see your data in your Splunk metric analytics.        
        </td>
           <td width="70%"><img src="/static/app/splunk4champions2/images/phy_screen3-4.jpg" width="90%"/></td>
           
        </tr>
      </table>

## Lab - Check data in a dashboard 
Use this <Link to="phyphox_start" openInNewContext> Phyphox - 4 Sensor Experiment </Link> dashboard. Android devices mostly have a light sensor, iphones send Pressure data instead. 

## Lab - Use Audio recognition

You can sing (if you can) or play notes on Piano (anything like https://muted.io/piano/ ) and use the dashboard to demonstrate Splunk audio note recognition: 
Use this <Link to="phyphox_audio_notes" openInNewContext> audio signal recognition dashboard </Link>to recognize and display notes played.
