## Phyphox app on your phone
This project leverages the RWTH Phyphox app to collect sensor data from mobile devices, enabling real-time analytics and insights. 
Phyphox, developed by RWTH Aachen University, is popular and trusted because it combines scientific rigor with accessibility and a focus on privacy. 

## Lab 
This lab contains following steps: 

1) Install the app on your phone (iPhone or Android) 
<Link to="https://phyphox.org/download/" openInNewContext> Phyphox App Download Page</Link>

2) Enable HEC : /en-GB/manager/splunk4champions2/http-eventcollector -> Edit Global Settings -> Enable
(Settings -> Data Inputs -> HTTP Event Collector -> Global Settings -> All Tokens "Enabled" )
    Copy token value for metrics data
3) Go to 
<Link to="download_phyphox_experiments" openInNewContext>Phyphox configuration generator dashboard </Link> and configure your experiment. This config file will contain your splunk address and the hec token, so the app will be able to send json data directly to Splunk. 

4) Transfer the xml-configuration file to your phone: you can use the camera and scan the QR code, than open the link, download the file and open with the phyphox app.
