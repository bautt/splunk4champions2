### 1. Universal Forwarder (File-Based)
1. Write metric events to a local file in JSON or CSV format.  
2. Extract `_time`, metric names, values, and dimension fields via props.conf/transforms.conf.  
3. Configure the UF to send those events to a **metric index**.

### 2. HTTP Event Collector (HEC)
1. Enable a HEC token in **Splunk Web** or **inputs.conf**.  
2. Send multivalue JSON payloads
    Example: 
```
curl -k https://v37823.1blu.de:8088/services/collector/event \
  -H "Authorization: Splunk 2ba9b54d-ded3-430a-b7b8-14e1f4bace6a" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"time":1634367600.000,"event":"metric","index":"piano-metrics","fields":{"note":"C4","note_name":"C","octave":4,"velocity":78,"duration":0.425}}'
```

### 3. Log-to-Metrics Conversion (Ingest-Time)
1. Define a **source type** under “Log to Metrics” in **Data Inputs**.  
2. Map JSON, CSV, or key=value fields to metric names, values, and dimensions.  
3. Splunk extracts and indexes metrics as events arrive.

### 4. Log-to-Metrics Conversion (Search-Time)
- **mcollect**: Converts search results into metric data points and writes them to a metric index.  
- **meventcollect**: Streams search results, converting and indexing them on the fly.

### 5. Metric Builder App (UI-Driven)
1. Install the **Metric Builder** dashboard.  
2. Define rules to map event fields into metric names, values, and dimensions.  
3. Apply in real time or schedule via saved searches.

### 6. Third-Party Integrations & Apps
- **Splunk Add-on for Infrastructure** and **Splunk Connect for Kubernetes** collect OS/container metrics.  
- **Splunk DB Connect** ingests numeric time-series from databases into a metric index.
