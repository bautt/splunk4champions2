### TERM directive avoids splitting in TERMs 

Compare: 
<SplunkSearch earliest="-30d" latest="now" spl={`index=_internal 127.0.0.1`}>
</SplunkSearch>

To: 

<SplunkSearch earliest="-30d" latest="now" spl={`index=_internal TERM(127.0.0.1)`}>
</SplunkSearch>

### TERM can only be used with minor breakers, not with major breakers: 

* Minor breakers: `/ : = @ . - $ # % \ _ `
* Major breakers: `` \r\n\s\t [] <> () {} | ! ; ‚ ‘ “``

### Highlighting TERMS: 
The easiest way to see minor and major breakers in action is to move the mouse over the log: 
whatever you can select in one peace contains only minor breakers and can be used with TERM or PREFIX directives:
